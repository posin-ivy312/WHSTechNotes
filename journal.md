The three sensors that are found on the spehero bolt are compass sensor, ambient light sensor, and infrared sensor.
The sephro bolt compass sensor while also using a magnetometer, this allows the sphero robot to know the location it is going to once placed on the ground. The magnetometer is designed to measure the magnetism of the surface the shepro robot is placed on. Then once the measure of magnetic field helps the robot to identify the magnetic north. This is why we can use Sphero Bolt as a compass.

In this lesson I didn't really understand it, once I read the instructions I started to understand the lesson a bit more. A step I didn't know how to do was copy and paste the code into the "start program". My partner was also confused on what to do but I help them figure out how to copy and paste. Once we finished the Sphero Bolt.

One daily activity that is conistent within my daily routine is watching netflix while doing homework. Computer science impacts my life indirectly because there are codes behind the app netflix to watch movies within the app itself. MY daily life would be awesome since I love going home and watching netflix therefore it is relaxing to do my homework and netflix. To summerize computer science is everywhere in my daily routine, i'm a screen addict when I am at home and at school so it affects me significantly.
