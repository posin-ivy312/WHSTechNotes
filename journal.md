The three sensors that are found on the spehero bolt are compass sensor, ambient light sensor, and infrared sensor.
The sephro bolt compass sensor while also using a magnetometer, this allows the sphero robot to know the location it is going to once placed on the ground. The magnetometer is designed to measure the magnetism of the surface the shepro robot is placed on. Then once the measure of magnetic field helps the robot to identify the magnetic north. This is why we can use Sphero Bolt as a compass.

In this lesson I didn't really understand it, once I read the instructions I started to understand the lesson a bit more. A step I didn't know how to do was copy and paste the code into the "start program". My partner was also confused on what to do but I help them figure out how to copy and paste. Once we finished the Sphero Bolt.

How does precision affect the outcome of the program? Precision affects the outcome of the program because if your not precisce with the codes then it will impact your final program which can lead to multiple issues. What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding? It will affect your program by not working to its full potential also it will create issues. Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey? Its essential to develop good habits of attention to detail in my coding journeu because it will help me accomplish and complete codes more easily and less stress which reduces mistakes within my codes.

One daily activity that is conistent within my daily routine is watching netflix while doing homework. Computer science impacts my life indirectly because there are codes behind the app netflix to watch movies within the app itself. MY daily life would be awesome since I love going home and watching netflix therefore it is relaxing to do my homework and netflix. To summerize computer science is everywhere in my daily routine, i'm a screen addict when I am at home and at school so it affects me significantly.

Coding can help improve skills by letting you know what you need to work on and how you can improve on that skill you are currently doing at the moment while writing a code. Understanding code can help you in industries by helping you or your fellow workers during their work time to help them improve on what they need to work on or what you all can do together while working. Coding helps you be creative because you can create different type of things different type of games and you can collaberate with people if your working on it with some different people so it will help you build a bettter experience with other people if you are working with anyone/ It will also help you figure out some different creative things.

Protecting person and sensitive information when publishing online I crucial due to the potential risk assosicated with data breaches, identity theft, abd pravacy violations. Sharing to much information can lead to unwanted explotation making it essential to be cautious about what we disclose. TO ensure the information shared on platforms like Github or social media remains secure several steps can be taken. First using a stron unique password and enabling 2 factor authentication can enhance security. I have never shared something online but if I had it would be immediatly dealt it and from my brain. Balancing openness and callaboration in online spaces especially in coding requires a thought full approach it is possible to engage with others while maintaining privacy by using only relevant information and providing personal identifiers.

A new york judge recently postpones a decision on Donald Trup request to apply presidential immunity in his hush money case. Trump legal team argued that a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity might sheild him from prosecution related to actions during his presidency. The delay extends the process, possibly impacting the timing of Trump sentencing, now tentaively scheduled for September 2024. This case involves allegations of fasifying business records to cover hush money payments linked to his 2006 presidential campaign. 
Advancements in computer science and technology could have a substantial impact on cases like Trump by streamlining legal processes, enhancing transparency, and supoorting data analysis. For indysnvr AI tools could aid judges and attorneys in reviewing complex evidence more efficently, potentially analyzing social media and digital records patterns relevant to official acts or personal actions. Blockchain technology could also improve record keeping in financial cases, securing evidence chains, and preventing data tampering, all of which might expediate legal processes in high profile cases such as Donald Trump case. There for the develpment of technology is extremly impactful to Donald Trump case since it can provide evidence and show how he's using the presidential election to his advantage.

Technology has a significantly transformed the food industry. Especially during the peak seasons. In particular in how we grow, distribute and purchase food. Advances in agriculture technology such as precision farming and GMo have increased crops and significantly reduces the cost of production. Also efficient logistics makes food more affordable and avaliable. Online shopping adds convenience. However downsides include enviromental damage from intensive farming practices, potential biodiversity loss, and the bulnerability of small producers in the supply chains. THe balance between technological advancements and sustainability is crucial for a health and equitable food system.

To me, brain rot perfectly describes thtat drained, foggy feeling after spending to much time scrolling through pointless content. This year i've fekt both tghe good and the bad sides of digital media. On one hand it keeps me connected and entertained but on the other, it's easy to get stuck in a cycle of watching or reading things that feel like a waste of time.

Government intervention has a significant impact on technology companies and their users by shaiping how platforms operate and how accesible they remain. In TikTok's case, the potential ban due to nation security conerns shows how governments prioritize data privacy and nation security over free access to global platform. For users, this can mean losing access to a platform they enjoy, while for companies, it might require major changes, such as storing data locally or even restructing ownership, to meet regulatory requirements. This sityation highlights the delicate balance between innovation and complaiance with government regulations.

If I were a develeoper at TikTok, I would implement a feature that provides users with complete transparency regarding how their data is stored and shared, For example, A Data Dashboard within the app could allow users to see where their data is stored, who has access to it, and the option to delete specific data points. This feature would address privacy concerns and show that TikTok is taking user data seriously. From this situation, I've learned that importance of incorporating privacy and security considerations early in app development. Applying these priciples to my projects would not align with ethical software development but would build trust with users, ensuring the longevity and reliability of the product.
