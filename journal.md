In this lesson I didn't really understand it, once I read the instructions I started to understand the lesson a bit more. A step I didn't know how to do was copy and paste the code into the "start program". My partner was also confused on what to do but I help them figure out how to copy and paste. Once we finished the Sphero Bolt.
